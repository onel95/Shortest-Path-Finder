# Project Description

This is an application that uses two different algorithms to find the shortest distance between two points on a weighted graph that can be input into the app as a txt file.

# Design

This program makes use of Object Oriented Design in order to create a robust and scalable application that has low coupling and high reusability since the classes are kept small and simple.

# Running Application

The application can be run through the project.java class since it contains the main method.

# Algorithms and Data Structures

Detailed description of the algorithms and data structures used can be found in the file Documentation.pdf.
